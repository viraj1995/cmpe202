The primary advantage that I noticed of using AspectJ for the gumball machine was that it made the code shorter and precise. It also became easy to maintain because managing the classes for each gumball machine could be a problem. Using AspectJ, we can easily change the structure by changing the config file and later add classes during compile time. It is important as we can separate business logic from other cross cutting logics.
